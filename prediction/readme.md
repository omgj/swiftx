# Category Prediction of PhotoLibrary Selection using MobileNetV2
The Model is not included, can be found here https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/. \
Include mlmodel in root folder.

User selects image via PHPicker, is presented with list of possible categories. All done locally on the phone.\
Even large sites like eBay, Shopify etc.. still have annoying categorization steps in product publication. Given their large databases of images and labels (title of the listing, as well as user inputted categories) training a model to streamline this section of the product listing process is feasible. If user is in browser we need to host the model, otherwise if through an app can be done locally (provided model can be compressed/optimized).\
It is frankly surprising that the listing process on these sites and sites like them are so archaic/manual given their massive databases of labelled images.\
Smart collections are anything but smart.
